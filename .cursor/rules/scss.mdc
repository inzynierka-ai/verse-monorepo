- Prefer @use over @import for module imports
- Use namespaces with imports (e.g., `@use "variables" as *`)
- use [variables.scss](mdc:apps/frontend/src/common/styles/variables.scss) and [mixins.scss](mdc:apps/frontend/src/common/styles/mixins.scss) when possible
- Use classes for each element, don't nest html selectors
- Use SCSS variables for colors, spacing, and other repeated values
- keep consistent styling across the app
- Apply consistent spacing between rule blocks
- Leverage pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) for decorative elements
- Use rem units for typography and spacing for better accessibility
- Implement responsive design with relative units (rem, vh, %)
- Structure complex layouts with flexbox
- Leverage nested & operator for hover and active states
- Implement performant animations (transform, opacity)
- Use z-index strategically for layering elements
- Apply consistent naming patterns for module files
