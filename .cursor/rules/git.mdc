# Git Usage Rules

## Commit Practices
- Commit every logical change you make
- Keep commits atomic and focused on one thing
- Use `gc` alias instead of regular git commit
- Use meaningful commit messages that explain "why" not just "what"
- don't use any prefixes refactor: fix: etc

## `gc` Alias
```bash
# gc alias stands for: git commit -m $1
# It automatically formats conventional commit messages
gc "your message here"
```
