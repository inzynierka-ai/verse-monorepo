# Frontend Development Guidelines

## React Conventions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for all components and functions
- Group related components in directories
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Use local state for component-specific state
- Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled ones

## Styling
- Use SCSS modules for styling
- Keep styling files close to their components
- Use variables for colors, fonts, and spacing

## Testing
- Write unit tests for components and utilities
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Test user interactions and state changes

## TypeScript
- Define types for all props and state
- Use interfaces for objects with methods
- Use type aliases for simple types
- Avoid using `any` type

## API Integration
- Use services for API calls
- Handle loading states and errors
- Use proper error handling and retry mechanisms
