## Next Services to Implement

### Story Controller

The Story Controller will maintain the game state, including:
- World facts and rules
- Character relationships and memories
- Game history and important events
- Current narrative state

It will provide context for the Scene Director to generate scenes.

### Scene Director

The Scene Director will be an agent-based system that:
- Takes the current game state from Story Controller
- Dynamically creates NPCs and locations as needed
- Generates narrative goals and scene structures
- Assembles coherent scenes for player interaction

### Narrator

The Narrator will:
- Generate natural language descriptions of scenes
- Create NPC dialogue and responses
- Narrate outcomes of player actions
- Maintain consistent tone and style throughout the game

## Implementation Flow

```
User Input → GameInitializer → Story Controller → Scene Director → Narrator → Player Interface
```

All subsequent scenes will be dynamically generated by the Scene Director based on player choices and the evolving game state managed by the Story Controller.
