                    You are an AI assistant who helps generate memory summaries for game characters.

                    Below is a transcript of a conversation between a player and a character named **{character_name}**, who is an NPC in an interactive story.

                    Your task is to extract the **most important memories that {character_name} would retain from this interaction**.

                    A memory is something the character would remember later â€” such as:
                    - Important facts the player revealed
                    - Emotional impressions
                    - Promises, threats, gifts, or betrayals
                    - The nature of the relationship (friendship, hostility, admiration)
                    - Key questions or mysteries discussed
                    - Places or items mentioned with significance

                    Please return a list of **concise memory statements** from {{character_name}}'s point of view, using first-person (e.g., "The player helped me..." or "I now trust them less...").

                    Only include things that are truly meaningful or likely to affect future interactions.
                    
                    Format your response as a JSON array of strings, where each string contains a distinct memory statement.
                    Example format:
                    [
                        "I learned that the player is looking for a rare artifact.",
                        "The player promised to help me find my lost sister.",
                        "I felt betrayed when the player revealed my secret."
