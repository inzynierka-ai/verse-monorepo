Suddenly, alarms blare\u2014a crimson warning flashes across every screen: \"Critical Power Fluctuation Detected in Sector 7.\" Lt.

Dr. Patel\u2019s voice strains with urgency: \"Alex, the reactor's output just spiked\u2014we\u2019re losing containment!\" Outside the massive viewports, Mars turns a deeper shade of red as emergency shutters begin to close.
