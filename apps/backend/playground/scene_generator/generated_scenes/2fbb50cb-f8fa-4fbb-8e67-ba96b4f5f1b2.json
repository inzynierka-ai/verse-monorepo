Its towering fa\u00e7ade showcases a blend of neoclassical and modern architectural styles, with massive granite columns etched with the names of former leaders, complemented by sleek glass panels that reflect the skies above. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of polished wood, aged leather, and cigar smoke.

The main chamber features a grand circular layout with a long, oval mahogany table surrounded by plush leather chairs, each adorned with insignias of various political factions. Murals depicting pivotal moments in the city's political history adorn the walls, while a massive skylight filters sunlight, mirroring the changing tides of power. Discreet alcoves provide refuge for secretive discussions, and the aroma of coffee and pastries lingers nearby, enhancing the vibrant atmosphere steeped in tension and ambition.",
