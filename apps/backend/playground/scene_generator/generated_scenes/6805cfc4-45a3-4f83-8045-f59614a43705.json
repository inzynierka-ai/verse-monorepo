  "description": "Inside the shimmering heart of Crystalspire Tower, Elara Windwhisper stands alongside Sylvia Nightshade and Zephyr. The chamber\u2019s walls pulse with shifting hues of blue and violet, casting prismatic shadows across ancient tomes and arcane instruments. Suddenly, the air crackles\u2014threads of wild, uncontrolled magic flicker through the room, distorting space and time for a heartbeat. Zephyr whirls around Elara, its form fracturing into dozens of tiny, sparkling breezes, while Sylvia raises a protective ward, her voice low and urgent. \"This is happening more often,\" Sylvia says, her black eyes reflecting the dancing lights. \"The return of magic is accelerating\u2014and not even Crystalspire\u2019s wards can contain it much longer.\" As the anomaly subsides, the three exchange tense glances, realizing that the world outside may soon be overwhelmed by forces none of them fully understand.",
