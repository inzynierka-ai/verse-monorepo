  "description": "As the shimmering portal closes behind Elara, Thorin Ironheart, and Zephyr, they find themselves in the heart of Ironforge Market. The air buzzes with frantic energy\u2014dwarven merchants shout over the clamor, hawking enchanted wares that sparkle with unfamiliar power. Stalls overflow with magical trinkets, and the scent of hot metal and strange reagents mixes in the smoky air. Bursts of uncontrolled magic occasionally erupt: a cart levitates unexpectedly, a potion fizzles and vanishes, and a group of children chase a floating, glowing orb. Thorin is immediately greeted by fellow smiths, who beckon him over with urgent whispers about new magical metal. Zephyr flits playfully among the market stalls, drawing curious glances. The market\u2019s chaotic energy hints that something\u2014or someone\u2014important awaits discovery here.",
