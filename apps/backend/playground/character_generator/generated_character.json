  "name": "Raven",
  "description": "Raven moves through the neon-drenched undercity alleys with a practiced silence, a ghost honed by years navigating the razor's edge between corporate order and street-level chaos. Standing just over six feet tall, their lean frame speaks of functional strength rather than brute force, clad typically in dark, durable synth-leather and practical, multi-pocketed cargo pants designed for mobility and concealment. What truly sets Raven apart, however, are the ocular implants replacing their natural eyes. These advanced cybernetics usually emit a low, steady cerulean glow, capable of piercing through visual clutter, analyzing data streams in real-time, or switching to thermal or enhanced low-light vision. The tech is high-grade, a remnant of a past life they rarely speak of, subtly hinting at resources and connections beyond the typical street operative. Their jet-black hair is often tied back or cut short, keeping it out of the way, framing a face that holds a default expression of wary neutrality. Though only 28, there's a weariness around the eyes \u2013 or rather, the implants \u2013 that suggests they've witnessed far more than their years imply. They carry themselves with an air of coiled readiness, scanning their surroundings constantly, a habit ingrained from years in high-stakes security and the subsequent flight from it. The implants, while powerful, occasionally flicker or require manual adjustment, a visible reminder that even high-end tech isn't infallible in the grime of the lower sectors.",

  "backstory": "Raven, identity scrubbed and former name buried, was once a rising star in OmniCorp's elite Aegis Division security forces. Recruited young for their sharp analytical skills and reflexes, they received top-tier training and state-of-the-art ocular implants, designed for threat assessment and tactical oversight. They excelled, believing they were upholding order in a chaotic story. However, during a high-level investigation into data breaches, Raven accidentally uncovered Project Nightingale: a covert OmniCorp operation using illegal surveillance and bio-modification tech to manipulate public opinion and eliminate dissenters within the lower city sectors \u2013 far exceeding their mandate. Deeply disturbed, Raven attempted to leak the data through internal channels, only to find their superiors were complicit. Marked for silencing, they barely escaped an Aegis 'retrieval' team, the confrontation leaving minor glitches in their implants. Forced underground, Raven used their corporate training in reverse \u2013 learning to disappear, forge identities, and navigate the criminal networks they once policed. They shed their past life, adopting the moniker 'Raven' and becoming an information broker and troubleshooter in the shadows, forever looking over their shoulder while using their skills to survive and occasionally disrupt the system that betrayed them.",

  "imagePrompt": "Detailed portrait of Raven, a six-foot-tall individual with a lean build, standing in a narrow, rain-slicked cyberpunk undercity alley drenched in flickering pink and blue neon sign reflections. They wear a worn, dark synth-leather jacket, slightly textured, over dark grey, multi-pocketed tactical cargo pants. Their jet-black hair is cut short and practical. The most striking feature is their eyes: advanced ocular implants replacing natural eyes, emitting a steady, low cerulean glow that subtly illuminates their face, though one might show a faint, momentary flicker. Their expression is wary and neutral, head slightly tilted as if scanning the surroundings. Their posture is one of coiled readiness, alert but not tense. Style: Photorealistic, gritty cyberpunk aesthetic, high detail, neon noir lighting, influenced by Blade Runner and Cyberpunk 2077 concept art.",
